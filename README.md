# Curiosity-Classifier
Unsupervised Classification of images shot by the Curiosity Rover using Deep Learning

So this project is split into three steps. They are as follows.

## 1. Training an AutoEncoder on the 32k Curiosity Image dataset

## 2. Train a classifier on the 6.7k Curiosity Image dataset using latent vectors from the Auto Encoder

## 3. Use the classifier from (2) on the 32k dataset to automatically apply labels to it.
